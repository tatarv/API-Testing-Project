## Project’s Objective
This project focuses on testing the Postman Library API v2, A REST API that allows you to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) books in a public library database. We will use Postman to interact with this API and manage books. The goal is to ensure the functionality, reliability, and performance of the API, ensuring that it works as intended. It involves sending requests to various endpoints, validating responses, and verifying the behavior of the APIs under different scenarios.

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods, data formats, and authentication mechanisms that applications use to interact with the API provider.

## What is an REST API?

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is commonly used in web development to create APIs that allow communication and data exchange between different systems.

A REST API operates based on a set of predefined rules and principles, making use of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform various operations on resources. It follows a client-server model, where the client sends requests to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or performs the requested action.

## API Testing: Concepts and Test planning

API testing refers to the practice of testing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure their functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

In this project, we will perform the following tests:

1. Smoke Testing: Type of software testing that focuses on quickly identifying major defects or issues in a software build or release. It is performed to ensure that the critical functionalities of the software are working as expected and to determine if further testing is necessary before proceeding with more comprehensive testing.
2. Functional Testing: Verifying that the API functions as expected by testing different scenarios and input combinations.
3. Request and Response Testing: Ensuring that the requests sent to the API are properly handled and the responses returned are correct, including status codes, headers, and payload data.
4. Data Validation: Validating the data format, data types, and data integrity in API requests and responses.
5. Performance Testing: Assessing the performance and scalability of the API by testing its response times, throughput, and resource usage under various loads and stress conditions.
